Here I pile up all the codes done by my own approach after solving problems from codeforces problem set. The solutions are in python language. Feel free to have a look at the process of my codes and give it a try by yourself.
Remember, grasping the solution does not make any difference.

And I am extremely sorry for the bad habit of not commenting :/
